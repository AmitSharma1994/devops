A kubeconfig file is a configuration file used by Kubernetes to manage cluster access. It contains information about clusters, users, namespaces, and authentication mechanisms. This file allows you to specify which cluster to interact with and how to authenticate to it.

Overview of its key components:
    Clusters: Information about the Kubernetes clusters you want to connect to.
    Users: Credentials and authentication methods for accessing the clusters.
    Contexts: Combinations of clusters and users, allowing you to switch between different environments easily.
    Namespaces: Default namespaces for the contexts.
    You can usually find the kubeconfig file in your home directory under ~/.kube/config. You can also specify a different file using the --kubeconfig flag when running kubectl commands.

Contexts:contexts is combination of a cluster, a user, and a namespace. Contexts allow you to switch between different Kubernetes environments easily without having to specify the cluster, user, and namespace each time you run a kubectl command.

#this commond is use to see the current context.
    kubectl config current-context
#To switch to a different context for  use.
    kubectl config use-context <your-context-name>

#define the config file for differnt-diffrent context like env(dev,sit,prod)
